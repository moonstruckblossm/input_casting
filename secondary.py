# Objectives:
#   1. Diamond
#       a. Define a function that accept the parameters listed below.
#           Name   | Type(s)         | Description
#           symbol | Integer / Float | The symbol used to create the diamond.
#
#           The function should print the chevron seen in the output below using the symbol.
#       b. Prompt input from the user in the form of a single character, save it to a variable.
#       c. Call the function you defined to create the diamond, sending the character as an argument.
#
#       HINT: Start with a smaller diamond! Then make it bigger once you figure out the pattern.

#           Name   | Type(s)         | Description
#           symbol1 | Integer / Float | The symbol used to create the diamond.
#           symbol2 | Integer / Float | The symbol used to create the frame.
#
#           The function should print the chevron seen in the output below using the symbol.
#       b. Prompt input from the user in the form of a single character, save it to a variable.
#       c. Prompt input from the user in the form of a single character again, and save it to a second variable.
#       d. Call the function you defined to create the framed diamond, sending the characters as arguments.
#
#       HINT: Start with a smaller diamond! Then make it bigger once you figure out the pattern.
